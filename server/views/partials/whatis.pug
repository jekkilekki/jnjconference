          | Teachers and their students can change and transform in positive ways 
          | through our shared experiences. The more creative ways teachers find 
          | to communicate with students, the more engaged those students can be in 
          | the classroom and in the world outside the classroom. The more we all 
          | engage with the world around us, the better citizens we become of our 
          | global community. We also have a shared responsibility to our professional 
          | community to help strengthen it with support and respect for all its diverse 
          | members.

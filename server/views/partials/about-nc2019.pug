  p The theme for this year's National Conference is "Be the Change: Creativity, Community & Collegiality in EFL." Teachers and their students can change and transform in positive ways through our shared experiences. The more creative ways teachers find to communicate with students, the more engaged those students can be in the classroom and in the world outside the classroom. The more we all engage with the world around us, the better citizens we become of our global community. We also have a shared responsibility to our professional community to help strengthen it with support and respect for all its diverse members. Let's be the change we wish to see in the worldâ€¦ In 2020 and beyond!
